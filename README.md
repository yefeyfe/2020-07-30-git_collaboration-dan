Git collaboration notes

- `git clone <utl>`: downloads the repository from the web to your local computer
    - make sure you don't nest this command into another repository
    - just like `git init`, only do this once per repo

- `git branch <branch_name>`: create a new branch where HEAD is
    - `git branch -a`: list all branches your local computer knows of
- `git switch <branch_name>`: move to branch
    - `git checkout <branch_name>`: the pre-august 2019 way
